# Automobile Sales Visualization – Analytical Report  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes historical automobile sales in the U.S. across recession and non-recession periods.  
The main focus is to visualize:  
- Trends in sales volume over time.  
- Effects of recession, GDP, unemployment, consumer confidence, and vehicle type on sales.  
- Relationships between price, advertising expenditure, and sales performance.  

---

## Visual Analysis & Insights  

### 1. Line Chart – Sales over Time  
- Sales fluctuate strongly with economic cycles.  
- Significant drops observed during major recessions: 1981–82, 2008–09, 2020 (Covid).  
- Recovery is evident after recessions but often delayed.  

---

### 2. Sales Trends by Vehicle Type during Recession  
- Small family cars and medium family cars show higher stability in sales compared to luxury/executive cars.  
- Sports and executive cars are the most affected during recessions (sharp decline).  

---

### 3. Recession vs Non-Recession – Sales Comparison  
- Average sales volume is significantly higher in non-recession periods.  
- During recessions, all vehicle types suffer, but basic models (Superminicar, Small family car) retain better resilience.  

---

### 4. GDP Variation (Subplots)  
- During recessions, GDP shows a clear downward slope.  
- In non-recession years, GDP shows a steady upward trend.  
This confirms strong correlation between GDP performance and auto sales.  

---

### 5. Bubble Plot – Seasonality Effect  
- Automobile sales are seasonal, peaking in certain months (end of Q2 and Q4).  
- Seasonality weights confirm that festive/holiday months boost sales.  

---

### 6. Scatter Analysis  
- Consumer Confidence vs Sales:  
  - Positive relationship → Higher confidence = Higher sales.  
- Price vs Sales (during recessions):  
  - Negative relationship → Higher vehicle prices correlate with lower sales volume in recession.  

---

### 7. Pie Chart – Advertising Expenditure (Recession vs Non-Recession)  
- Majority of ad expenditure occurs during non-recession years.  
- Companies spend cautiously during recessions, limiting impact on boosting sales.  

---

### 8. Pie Chart – Advertising by Vehicle Type (Recession)  
- Advertising is concentrated on small family cars & medium family cars during recessions.  
- Luxury & sports models get less ad focus since demand falls sharply.  

---

### 9. Countplot – Unemployment Effect  
- Higher unemployment during recessions strongly reduces sales across all vehicle types.  
- Budget-friendly cars (small/supermini) retain more demand compared to luxury types.  

---

## Key Recommendations  

1. Marketing Strategy:  
   - Focus ad spending on small and medium family cars during recession years.  
   - Reduce marketing for sports/executive cars in downturns (low ROI).  

2. Pricing Strategy:  
   - Introduce discounts/incentives for higher-priced vehicles during recessions.  
   - Promote affordable financing options to sustain sales.  

3. Policy Insight:  
   - Automobile sales are a strong economic indicator, highly sensitive to GDP, unemployment, and consumer confidence.  
   - Policymakers should monitor sales as a leading indicator for recessions.  

4. Seasonality:  
   - Boost marketing campaigns in seasonal high-sales months (holiday/festive periods) to maximize ROI.

## Conclusion  
Automobile sales are highly cyclical and tied closely to macroeconomic indicators.  
- Recession → Lower sales, higher price sensitivity, lower ad spend effectiveness.  
- Non-Recession → Stronger growth, luxury sales recover.  
- Best resilience observed in budget and family car segments.
